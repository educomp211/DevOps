What is inode in Linux?
    Inodes store information about files and directories (folders), such as file ownership, access mode (read, write, execute permissions), and file type

AlmostOutOfinodes  troubleshooting steps ?
   commands to check - ls -li /path
   commnads to check - df -i /mountpoint
   Switch node into maintenance mode, stop the main service (most probably tomcat.service)
      systemctl stop tomcat.service
   To see the largest directory in inode usage
       find <mountpoint> -xdev -printf '%h\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1 -n
   Create a screen session
       screen -S inodes_recovery
   in order to remove empty directories run the below command:
        find <mountpoint>/<directory> -type d -empty -mtime +365 -exec rmdir {} \; 2> /home/<user>/purged_dirs
   Check the state of inodes:
        df -ih <mountpoint>
   Restore services and put node back to the rotation
        systemctl start tomcat.service

What happens if you run out of inodes?
    The moment a file system runs out of inodes, all new files and folders will be rejected, ie. data loss

difference between scp and rsync ?
   scp - scp is faster if you need to transfer a single set of unique files over an encrypted link
         Secure Copy (SCP) uses SSH to copy only the files or directories that you select
         
         Copy a Local File to a Remote System:
            scp file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory
            
         Copy a Remote File to a Local System:
            scp remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/file.txt /local/directory
            
            
   rsync - RSYNC is faster If you're syncing a directory that may have redundant files, RSYNC through an SSH tunnel is your target if you need more security.
           Rsync copies all files and directories and then it copies only the files and directories that you have changed
           a -  archive mode
           r - copy recurssively
           z - compress files
           h - humar readable
           v - verbose
     
           Copy/Sync Files and Directory on local computer:
              rsync -zvh backup.tar.gz /tmp/backups/
              
           Copy/Sync a Directory on Local Computer:   
               rsync -avzh /root/rpmpkgs /tmp/backups/
               
           Copy/Sync Files and Directory to or From a Server:
               rsync -avzh /root/rpmpkgs root@192.168.0.141:/root/
               
            Rsync Over SSH:
               Copy a File from a Remote Server to a Local Server with SSH:
                  rsync -avzhe ssh root@192.168.0.141:/root/anaconda-ks.cfg /tmp
                  
                Copy a File from a Local Server to a Remote Server with SSH:
                   rsync -avzhe ssh backup.tar.gz root@192.168.0.141:/backups/
                   
                Show Progress While Transferring Data with rsync:
                   rsync -avzhe ssh --progress /root/rpmpkgs root@192.168.0.141:/root/rpmpkgs
                   
                 Do a Dry Run with rsync:
                    rsync --dry-ru
                    
                 Automatically Delete source Files
                    rsync --remove-source-files

 Suppose, if puppet certificate is expired on a node, how to renew or create new certificate ?
   steps:
       1st step, run commands on slave node first to check the puppet cert directory, delete SSL certificate:
           puppet config print ssldir --section agent
           find /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl -name <nodename> -delete
           rm -rf /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/*
               
       2nd step , then, run commands on puppet master:
           puppet cert clean <nodename>
           
       3rd step, again run command on slave node so it will generate new certificate :  
            puppet agent -t
            
       4th step, then again run command on puppet master so it will sign the certificate,
            puppet cert sign <nodename>
            
            
How to remove certificates manually from a puppet master for a give slave node:
       Steps:
           Login to the puppet master node
              then run commands like:
                 puppet node deactivate <nodename>
                 puppet cert clean <nodename>

How to check which specific process is utilizing how much of memory, cpu and from which command it is running ?

Rolling Deployment ?
   A rolling deployment is a deployment strategy that updates running instances of an application with the new release. All nodes in a target environment are incrementally updated with the service 
   
Blue-Green Deployment ?
   Blue-green deployment is a deployment strategy that utilizes two identical environments, a “blue” (aka staging) and a “green” (aka production) environment with different versions of an application or service
   User traffic is shifted from the green environment to the blue environment once new changes have been testing and accepted within the blue environment
   Rollback is also straightforward, because you can simply flip traffic back to the old environment in case of any issues
   
Canary Deployment ?
   A canary deployment is a deployment strategy that releases an application or service incrementally to a subset of users. All infrastructure in a target environment is updated in small phases (e.g: 2%, 25%, 75%, 100%).
   it does not require two production environments. And finally, it is fast and safe to trigger a rollback to a previous version of an application.

What is a proxy server or forward proxy ?
A proxy server is a server that routes traffic between client and system, usually external to the network, convert and mask client IP addresses, enforce security protocols, and block unknown traffic

shiva What is a reverse proxy?
a reverse proxy is used to protect servers. A reverse proxy is a server that accepts a request from a client, forwards the request to another one of many other servers, and returns the results from the server that actually processed the request to the client as if the proxy server had processed the request itself. The client only communicates directly with the reverse proxy server and it does not know that some other server actually processed its request.    


INIT levels ?
The standard LINUX kernel supports these seven different runlevels :

0 – System halt i.e the system can be safely powered off with no activity.
1 – Single user mode.
2 – Multiple user mode with no NFS(network file system).
3 – Multiple user mode under the command line interface and not under the graphical user interface.
4 – User-definable.
5 – Multiple user mode under GUI (graphical user interface) and this is the standard runlevel for most of the LINUX based systems.
6 – Reboot which is used to restart the system.
